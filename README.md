# Resource Balancer

## Description
You are currently working with highly specialized devices that may perform a **single background task** and a **single foreground task**.
Each task consumes a fixed number of resources **(resource consumption)** from the device’s available **resource capacity**. E.g., a device with a capacity of 3 may run the following configurations:
- A background task that consumes 1 resource and a foreground task that consumes 2 resources or vice versa.
- A background task that consumes 1 resource and a foreground task that consumes 1 resource.

From the previously enumerated configurations, only the former can be considered an **optimal configuration.**
A device may not be configured with tasks whose sum of **resource consumption** surpasses the device’s **resource capacity.**

# Complex Numbers

## Description
A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form *a* + *b***i**,
where *a* and *b* are real numbers, and **i** is a solution of the equation *x*² = -1. 
Because no real number satisfies this equation, **i** is called an imaginary number. 
For the complex number *a* + *b***i**, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part.
